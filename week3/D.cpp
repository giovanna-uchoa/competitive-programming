Problem: D - Factory Machines
Source: Vjudge (https://vjudge.net/contest/702854#problem/D)

Approach:
  - Binary search on time `t` in the range [1, min(k) * P]
  - For each mid time, compute total items produced by all machines: sum(t / k[i])
  - If the production is â‰¥ P, try to lower the upper bound.
  - Else, move the lower bound up.
  - Final answer is the minimum time where the production goal is met.

Time Complexity: O(n log(min(k) * P))
Space Complexity: O(n)

Error Encountered:
  - The binary search was adjusted to avoid overflow by using long long for time calculations.
