/**
Problem: A - Hotels Along the Croatian Coast
Source: Vjudge (https://vjudge.net/contest/711092#problem/A)

Approach: Sliding Window (Two Pointers)
    - Store the hotel values in a vector.
    - Use a sliding window technique with two pointers (`i` and `j`) to represent the current segment of consecutive hotels.
    - Expand the window by moving the right pointer (`j`) and adding the value of the current hotel to the sum.
    - If the sum exceeds the limit `M`, shrink the window by moving the left pointer (`i`) and subtracting the value of the hotel at `i` from the sum.
    - Track the maximum sum of any valid segment (sum â‰¤ M) during this process.

Time Complexity: O(N) - Each pointer traverses the array at most once.
Space Complexity: O(N) - To store the hotel values.
